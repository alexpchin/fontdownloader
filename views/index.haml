  %a{href: "/"} Font Downloader 
  allows you to input any url and download the fonts that are embedded in that website's stylesheet. 
  %a{href: "/"} Font Downloader 
  should only be used to download fonts that you are allowed to access.

%h2 How to include the font?
%p 
  Once you have downloaded the zip file of the fonts from the url (if there are any), then this is the most common way to include a custom font in CSS:

%pre
  %code.language-css
    = @css

%p 
  Things are shifting heavily toward WOFF though, so you can probably get away with:

%pre
  %code.language-css
    = @woff
